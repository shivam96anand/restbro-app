# Setup GitHub branch protection rulesets for Restbro repos.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - gh CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`)
#   - You must be the repo owner
#
# Usage:
#   chmod +x scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh
#   ./scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh
#
# This creates rulesets (not classic branch protection) which support
# bypass actors — allowing the owner to push/merge directly while
# requiring 2 approvals for everyone else.
